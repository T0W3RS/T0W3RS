<p align="justify"> Mechanical Engineer, Master's in Computational Modeling, Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering. My first exposure to programming was during college when I started using the C language. During my master's degree, I switched to MATLAB because of its easier use of mathematical functionalities. Since then, programming has been an interesting topic for me, although not my central focus yet. Nowadays, I intend to fully immerse myself in programming.

<p align="justify"> Mechanical Engineer, Master's in Computational Modeling, Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering. My first exposure to programming was during college when I started using the C language. During my master's degree, I switched to MATLAB because it was easier to code using its mathematical functionalities. Programming has been an interesting topic for me, although I used it primarily for scientific purposes. Nowadays, I intend to fully immerse myself in data analysis and backend programming.

As a Researcher, I have applied my skills and knowledge in programming, data analysis and computational modeling to multidisciplinary research projects aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. I have worked on the optical characterization of photosensitive drugs, using laser beam modulation techniques and spectral methods to assess their efficacy and safety. I also hold a master's degree in computational modeling, where I developed a new application for a deterministic approach to the spectral method on neutron shielding problems. Prior to that, I gained valuable experience in contract management, project planning, maintenance, audits, and budgeting as an Operations Coordinator. I was responsible for ensuring the optimal performance and compliance of vessels and crew, managing maintenance activities and contracts, and addressing audit non-conformities.
